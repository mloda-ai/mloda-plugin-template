# Security Policy

> **Template note:** This file ships with the plugin template. If you create a
> plugin from it, update the contact below to your own private channel (and
> keep or remove this note as you see fit).

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version and the `main`
branch. We do not backport fixes to older releases — please upgrade to the
latest version before reporting.

| Version        | Supported          |

| Older releases | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
pull requests, or discussions.** This keeps users protected while a fix is
prepared.

Instead, use one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred) — open the **Security**
   tab of this repository and click **Report a vulnerability**. This keeps the
   report, discussion, and coordinated disclosure in one place.
2. **Email** — for plugins in the mloda organization, write to
   **security@mloda.ai**. If you forked this template, use your own address.

Please include as much of the following as you can:

- The type of issue (e.g. injection, path traversal, deserialization,
  dependency vulnerability).
- The affected module or file path (`file.py:line` if known).
- Step-by-step reproduction or a proof of concept.
- The potential impact and any suggested mitigation.

## What to Expect

- We'll get in touch to acknowledge your report.
- We'll assess the severity and keep you updated as we work toward a fix.
- We're happy to credit you in the advisory once it's published, unless you
  prefer to remain anonymous.

We follow coordinated disclosure: we ask that you give us a reasonable window
to release a fix before any public disclosure.
